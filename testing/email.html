        <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">We're one of the premier student newspapers in the nation. In our <b>107-year history</b> we've continuously pushed for <b>excellence in journalism</b> and education.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">The most remarkable fact is this: the <em>Jacket</em> is <b>entirely student-operated</b> and is produced by a dedicated staff of over one hundred student editors, writers, photographers, illustrators, and designers on a very limited budget every week.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">We don't accept any funding from the school, so we have to fundraise every dime that is required for printing the newspaper and maintaining our website. Printing costs over $800 each issue, and we print 18 times a year.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">This year we plan to continue the publication of several special issues, including the Black History Month issue, Women's Month issue, Chicanx/Latinx Heritage Month issue, and the Graduation issue for the end of the year. As we kick off another great year, we are writing to ask for your support so we can do our important journalistic and educational work.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">On behalf of every student in the <em>Jacket</em> program, we thank you for your support. <b>Any amount you can contribute</b> helps us achieve our goals, and your contribution is tax-deductible. For as long as there are dedicated writers and interested readers—and committed supporters like you—<span class="highlight">the <em>Jacket</em> will continue providing a platform for professional-level student journalism to shine long into the future.</span></p>
