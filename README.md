Developed in March-April 2020 by Jerome Paulos (10th Grade) with
PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few libraries: Swiper.js and jQuery.

This theme is dependent on the following plugins: Advanced Custom Fields PRO, Advanced Custom Fields Extended, ACF Enhanced Message Field, Shortcodes Ultimate, Shortcodes Ultimate: Shortcode Creator, Co-Authors Plus, possibly more.

Disabling them will likely break EVERYTHING. Copies of these plugins, as well as some other important plugins, should be included with this theme, just in case.
