Developed in March-April 2020 by Jerome Paulos (10th Grade) with
PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few libraries.

This theme is dependent on the following plugins: Advanced Custom Fields PRO, Advanced Custom Fields Extended, ACF Enhanced Message Field, Shortcodes Ultimate, Shortcodes Ultimate: Shortcode Creator, Co-Authors Plus, possibly more.

Disabling them will likely break EVERYTHING. Copies of these plugins, as well as some other important plugins, should be included with this theme, just in case.

This theme uses the following amazing libraries:
* [jQuery by John Resig](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Swiper.js by Vladimir Kharlampidi](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/)
* [Text Balancer by The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/text-balancer)
* [medium-zoom by Fran√ßois Chalifour](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom)
